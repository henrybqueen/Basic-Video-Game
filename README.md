This is a basic multiplayer video game I built using the pygame library. Each player controls a UFO and can shoot laser beams at the other player. Occasionally a strawberry will appear which gives the player who eats it a extra powerful attack. 

Except for the background and strawberry, all images used in the game were created by myself.
